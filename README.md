- Compute daily, monthly, and yearly statistics for temperature, rainfall, and humidity.
- Generate visualizations:
  - Daily temperature trends (line chart)
  - Monthly rainfall totals (bar chart)
  - Humidity vs temperature (scatter plot)
  - Combined plots of temperature and rainfall
- Group data by month and calculate aggregated statistics.
- Export cleaned data, summary statistics, plots, and a textual report.
